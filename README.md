# Prism â€” Code Editor based on Java Swing

> **Status:** ðŸš§ *Under active development* ðŸš§<br> 
> **Platform:** Windows 7 (x86-64) â†’ Latest Windows release  

**Prism** is an **open-source**, **lightweight**, **super-fast**, and **highly customizable** code editor built entirely with **Java Swing**. Designed for performance and simplicity, Prism aims to deliver a smooth editing experience for developers who prefer a native desktop editor without the overhead of large frameworks.

**Prism** is software designed for low-end computers, especially for users who still continue using outdated operating system versions, such as Windows 7. The application keeps its simplicity, without AI integration, and especially its performance.

If you currently have a device that has the ability to run other IDEs without any issues, then we recommend you not use Prism, unless you want to try it out!
