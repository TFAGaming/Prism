### Note:

**Prism** is software designed for low-end computers, especially for users who still continue using outdated operating system versions, such as Windows 7. The application keeps its simplicity, without AI integration, and especially its performance.

If you currently have a device that has the ability to run other IDEs without any issues, then we recommend you not use Prism, unless you want to try it out!
